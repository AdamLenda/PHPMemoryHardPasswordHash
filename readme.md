#Memory Hard Hashes
Due to developments in GPU hashing simple salted hashes of passwords are no longer safe from cracking by hackers. As I _never_ want to be a feature in Steve Gibson's "Doing it Wrong" series, I decided to write a function to do this "right." However, it is quite possible I've gotten it wrong and I encourage anyone who finds a flaw to let me know.
#Why?
Because I didn't know of an existing open source solution for solving this problem in PHP. If I missed something, please let me know.
